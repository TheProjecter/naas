Critical Limit Spectra
======================

Three 8192 channel spectra with average continuum levels of 100, 1000 and 10,000 counts per channel 
each containing 50 peaks. Each peak is a Gaussian distribution and contains the number of counts 
equivalent to the Currie critical limit, taking into account the average continuum level (b),
the peak width (n) at the specified. The background width (m) is fixed at 5 channels on each 
side of the peak when making the critical limit calculation.

The equation for Lc is 1.645 × (Std. Uncert of peak background)
That reduces to Lc = 1.645 × sqrt[ n × b × (1 + n/2m) ]
n is calculated as 2 × FWHM (channels) × 2.807 / 2.355, rounded up to the next integer.
2.807 is the coverage factor for 99.5% of the whole peak area.
When SpecMaker created the spectrum ,the counts in the peak were spread, as a Gaussian 
distribution, across those n channels.

The 50 peaks are superimposed on the continuum 40 keV apart from 50 keV up to 2010 keV.


Spectrum		Continuum
			(counts per channel)
LC-100			100
LC-1k			1,000
LC-10k			10,000


The 'Critcal Limit-an1' folder contains spectra in the ORTEC .an1 format.
The 'Critcal Limit-.chn' folder contains spectra in the ORTEC .chn format.
The 'Critcal Limit-csv' folder contains the SpecMaker output csv files listing the peaks positions
and the expected number of counts in the peaks, together with the expected position and FWHM.
An example follows:

The 'Critical Limit Info.txt' file is this document.
The 'Critical Limit-an1.zip' compressed file carries the an1 files and the associated .csv files.
The 'Critical Limit-chn.zip' compressed file carries the chn files and the associated .csv files.
The 'Critical Limit Assessments.zip' compressed file carries a number pdf files illustrating the
use of SpecMaker in assessing the performance of CompAct, FitzPeaks and GammaVision. These files
should be regarded as examples, not as definitive performance indicators. These files carry
copyright restrictions and must not be reported or published elsewhere.
